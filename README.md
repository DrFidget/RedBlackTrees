# Red-Black Tree Implementation

This project contains a C++ implementation of a Red-Black Tree data structure. The project consists of three main files:

1. `input.txt`: This file is used for input data. You can add integer values to this file that will be used to create the Red-Black Tree.

2. `RBT.h`: This header file contains the implementation of the Red-Black Tree data structure, including insertion, traversal, searching, and other related operations.

3. `main.cpp`: This file provides a user interface for interacting with the Red-Black Tree. It presents a menu to the user with various options to manipulate and explore the Red-Black Tree.

## Usage

To use the Red-Black Tree implementation, follow these steps:

1. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

2. Run the executable generated after compilation.

3. The program will display a menu with different options:
   - Enter 1 to insert values into the tree one by one.
   - Enter 2 to search for a value in the tree.
   - Enter 3 to perform a pre-order traversal (NLR).
   - Enter 4 to perform an in-order traversal (LNR).
   - Enter 5 to perform a post-order traversal (LRN).
   - ...
   - Enter 10 to read integer values from the file `input.txt` to create a Red-Black Tree.
   - Enter 11 to destroy the entire tree.
   - Enter 12 to print the tree level-wise.
   - Enter 13 to exit the program.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired operations on the Red-Black Tree.
